## Dijkstra
Input as follows:
```
|V| |E|
u_0 v_0 w_0 (meaning u_0 connected to v_0 by a edge with weight w_0 and v_0 connected to u_0 by a edge with weight w_0)
... (|E| times)
s t (The vertices you wanna know the shortest path)
```

## Ford-Fulkerson
Input as follows:
```
|V| |E|
u_0 v_0 w_0 (meaning u_0 connected to v_0 by a edge with weight w_0)
... (|E| times)
s t (A valid source and target)
```

## Prim
Input as follows:
```
|V| |E|
u_0 v_0 w_0 (meaning u_0 connected to v_0 by a edge with weight w_0 and v_0 connected to u_0 by a edge with weight w_0)
... (|E| times)
```

Input as follows:
```
|V| |E|
u_0 v_0 w_0 (meaning u_0 connected to v_0 by a edge with weight w_0)
